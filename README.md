# Weather Application

## Description

This is a basic weather web application that shows you the weather for the current week in any desired city in the world with a list of events that are happening in that city. The weather information is powered by both OpenWeather API and OpenCage Geocoding API. Events list is generated by Ticketmaster API. Users can also store their favorite cities with a click of a button.

This app is deployed and hosted on GitHub Pages. Click this [link](https://lunargravity.github.io/weather-app/) for the live demo.

## API Troubleshooting

- Correct City Name: Ensure the city name is spelled correctly. An incorrect city name will automatically set the location to **Needmore, Texas, USA**. If there is an error when fetching the city, the location will be set to **Nowhere, Oklahoma, USA**. (_I hope that you think that's funny_).
- API Rate Limits: Due to the limited number of requests allowed with the free trial API key, you may encounter restrictions after a certain number of requests. To avoid this, you can sign up for your own API key and replace the existing one in the code.

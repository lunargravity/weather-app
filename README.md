# Weather Application

## Description

This is a basic weather web application that shows you the weather for the current week in any desired city in the world with a list of events that are happening in that city. The weather information is powered by both OpenWeather API and OpenCage Geocoding API. Events list is generated by Ticketmaster API. Users can also store their favorite cities with a click of a button.

This app is deployed and hosted on GitHub Pages. Click this [link](https://lunargravity.github.io/weather-app/) for the live demo.

## API Troubleshooting

- If you do not write the city name correctly, it will not be able to find the location.
- There is a limit to how many requests can be made because of my api key free trial. If you want to make more requests, you can sign up for your own api keys and replace it in the code

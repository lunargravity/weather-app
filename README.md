# Weather Application

## Description

This is a basic weather web application that shows you the weather for the current week in any desired city in the world with a list of events that are happening in that city. The weather information is powered by both OpenWeather API and OpenCage Geocoding API. Events list is generated by Ticketmaster API. Users can also store their favorite cities with a click of a button.
